This summer, I'm working as a Lapenta Intern at the National Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland. 
In this role, I'll be developing and optimizing GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) Product Engineering Tools. These software programs help satellite operators on the ground monitor and receive real-time updates on the status of the 4 GOES satellites currently in orbit around Earth.
