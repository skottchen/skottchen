## Hi there, I'm Scott. Thanks for visiting my GitHub! 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me...
I will soon be graduating from the University of Maryland, College Park, in August with a B.S. in Information Science. After graduation, I hope to secure a full-time software development role in the space or satellite industry, ideally aligned with the work I'm doing during my internship (see next section). 

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...
This summer, I'm working as a Lapenta Intern at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland, where I develop and optimize GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) Product Engineering Tools. These tools support satellite operators with real-time monitoring, diagnostics, performance tracking, and anomaly detection for the four GOES satellites currently in orbit around Earth. The tech stack that I'm utilizing for this role is Python, Bash, Linux, and Git.
