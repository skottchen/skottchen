## Hi there, I'm Scott. Thanks for visiting my GitHub! 

## ℹ️ About me...
I will soon be graduating from the University of Maryland, College Park, in August with a B.S. in Information Science. After graduation, I hope to secure a full-time software development role in the space or satellite industry, ideally aligned with the work I'm doing during my internship (see next section). 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
This summer, I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland, where I develop and optimize GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) Image Navigation and Registration Tools. The tech stack that I'm utilizing for this role is Python, Bash, Linux, and Git.
